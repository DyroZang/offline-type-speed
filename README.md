# offline-type-speed
An offline typing speed test

This project utilizes matplotlib, time, sys, random

This project is a simple typing speed test that pulls a random prompt made of 10 words from words.txt file. 

This file is just a 10,000 word file.

It calculates typing speed using the formula (character count / 5 ) / (seconds / 60)

It can also be used to find your average typing speed after doing a couple of races. If you are downloading the files directly from the master branch then you would have to open 'wpmhistory.txt' and just delete everything from the file in order to restart the speed history rather than using mine.
